## Risks
* Loosing warranty
* Messing up the system
* Bricking the headunit
* Makine the car inoperable

## Known issues
* Well, it doesn't work yet!

## TODO
* Preatty much everything right now...
* VW Composition Media MIB2 - one could use radiostation logo DB update vector.
* Dumping interesing files to SD card
* Replacing system UI elements
* Replacing system SFX

## How it works
1. Infotainment unit recognizes content of the SD card as Personal-POI update
1. `./metainfo2.txt` file contains list of Variants that the update applyies to and paths for files specific for each variant (for example `./PersonalPOI/MIB2TSD`).
1. Next `./PersonalPOI/MIB2DE/metainfo2.txt` file is processed. Again it contains list of variants but also files&directories to copy, destination paths, checksums. Altering destination path will force custom `.esd` file to be coppied to the infotainment file system.
1. `mib2std-toolbox.esd` file is an additional green engeneering menu screen which gives you access to running custom scripts.

## Research files
1. `Research/variants.csv` - list of variants with carmaker, hardware producer, and other details.
